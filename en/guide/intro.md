# What is Raptor? {#what-is-raptor}

Raptor is an AI-powered CTF problem-solving assistant tool. It can (to some extent) help you automatically analyze problems, solve challenges, run scripts, and submit Flags.

## Use Cases {#use-cases}

- **CTF Competition**

  Thanks to the support of AI Agents and integration with competition platforms (currently only [GZCTF](https://github.com/GZTimeWalker/GZCTF) is supported), users can use the tool for problem analysis and solution ideas during competitions, or leverage the AI-assisted solving feature to greatly improve efficiency.

- **Personal Learning**

  As a problem-solving assistant, Raptor can also serve as a learning reference to help users better understand CTF-related knowledge. We provide a CTF Q&A assistant based on Dify (powered by [Hello-CTF](https://hello-ctf.com/)), which you can use directly within Raptor.

- **Others**

  In addition to the above dedicated scenarios, Raptor can also be used as a general AI chat tool to help users accomplish various tasks (currently, uploading files of any format is not supported).

## User Experience {#user-experience}

Thanks to Python's powerful extensibility and controllability, Raptor runs extremely efficiently. Under good network conditions, it only takes 1-2 minutes to analyze and solve a problem, greatly improving CTF solving efficiency.

Additionally, Raptor supports AI script generation and automatic execution. It will automatically generate the corresponding script according to the problem requirements and run it, striving to obtain the Flag autonomously without manual intervention.

If your competition uses GZCTF as the platform, Raptor can also automatically fetch problem information, download attachments, submit Flags, and more, greatly simplifying the CTF solving process and eliminating the need to repeatedly open the browser for operations.
